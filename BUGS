QSvgStyle
---------
* Capsule drawing is still incorrect : use painter clipping instead of performing capsule related calculation (warning : eval impact on performance ?)
* Capsule drawing : use specific hsep/vsep element that maintains interior consistency

-- Slider
* slider full part in vertical mode: not centered
  (same for empty part when controls are inverted)
  (groove seems 1 pixel wider than expected)

-- Tab
* tab bar close button overlaps frame (thick frames)
* implement PE_IndicatorTabTear*

-- Toolbar
* rtl separators/handles

-- Progressbar
* overdraw in busy progress bar in vertical mode
* glitch for FULL and WRAP busy progressbar type


-- Dock
* dock widget buttons overlap with frame
  -> when docked, frame is for title
  -> when floating, frame is for whole dock
  -> set title margin to 0 and apply standard qsvgstyle rendering for labels
  -> title rect should be reduced by the size of the visible buttons
  -> buttons should be moved inside frame
  -> PE_FrameDockWidget is never called

-- Scroll
* use own indicators instead of generic arrows that
  have the pushbutton specs

Qt limitations
--------------
* Toolboxes: QToolBox does not ask the style for a size (sizeFromContents()),
  as such glitches will appear when the toolbox tab frame width is > 2
* ToolBoxes: tool box tab is not repainted when underlying content widget
  changes enabled status
* Frames of types HLine and VLine: height/width is hardcoded to 3
* Progressbars cannot be made smaller than font height+2 even if they do
  not display text. Cheat is to insert invisible elements to make
  it look smaller
* There is no spacing between toolbar handle and first button
* Despite SH_TitleBar_NoBorder set to true, QMdiSubWindow class will show a
resize handle on the title bar of the size of PM_MdiSubWindowFrameWidth and it
will overlap the title
* When using QSvgThemeBuilder to adjust some indicator sizes, the widget
may not apply the new size. This is because this indicator is used as an icon
and that the widget caches it. Example: size of "clear" button in line edits


QSvgThemeBuilder
