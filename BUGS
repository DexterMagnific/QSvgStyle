QSvgStyle
---------
* Capsule drawing is still incorrect : use painter clipping instead of performing capsule related calculation (warning : eval impact on performance ?)
* Capsule drawing : use specific hsep/vsep element that maintains interior consistency

* implement frame for default buttons
* implement default button indicator for auto default buttons
* slider full part in vertical mode: not centered
  (same for empty part when controls are inverted)
  (groove seems 1 pixel wider than expected)
* view items: size does not take into account label margins

Qt limitations
--------------
* Toolboxes: QToolBox does not ask the style for a size (sizeFromContents()),
  as such glitches will appear when the toolbox tab frame width is > 2
* Frames of types HLine and VLine: height/width is hardcoded to 3
