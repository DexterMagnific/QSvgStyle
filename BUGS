QSvgStyle
---------
* Capsule drawing is still incorrect : use painter clipping instead of performing capsule related calculation (warning : eval impact on performance ?)
* Capsule drawing : use specific hsep/vsep element that maintains interior consistency

-- Slider
* slider full part in vertical mode: not centered
  (same for empty part when controls are inverted)
  (groove seems 1 pixel wider than expected)
* should ticks be drawn above or under cursor ?

-- View item
* reimplement CE_ItemViewItem so that text rendering will take into
  account text margins
* do not draw "normal" interior

-- Tab
* tab bar close button overlaps frame (thick frames)
* implement PE_FrameTabBarBase
* use different variants for tabs and contents

-- Title bar
* implement CC_TitleBar support
* implement SP_TitleBar* pixmaps

-- Toolbar
* There is no spacing between toolbar handle and first button
* rtl separators/handles

-- Progressbar
* overdraw in busy progress bar in vertical mode

-- Dock
* dock widget buttons overlap with frame
  -> when docked, frame is for title
  -> when floating, frame is for whole dock
  -> set title margin to 0 and apply standard qsvgstyle rendering for labels
  -> title rect should be reduced by the size of the visible buttons
  -> buttons should be moved inside frame
  -> PE_FrameDockWidget is never called

-- Scroll
* use different variants for buttons and groove and cursor
* use own indicators instead of generic arrows that
  have the pushbutton specs

-- Group box
* implement bottom titles for group box

-- Scroll area
* implement PE_PanelScrollAreaCorner

-- Standard pixmaps

Qt limitations
--------------
* Toolboxes: QToolBox does not ask the style for a size (sizeFromContents()),
  as such glitches will appear when the toolbox tab frame width is > 2
* ToolBoxes: tool box tab is not repainted when underlying content widget
  changes enabled status
* Frames of types HLine and VLine: height/width is hardcoded to 3
* Progressbars cannot be made smaller than font height+2 even if they do
  not display text. Cheat is to insert invisible elements to make
  it look smaller
